# :curly_loop: GeomPy :curly_loop:
Super cool Differential Geometry Library for Python

# The Idea
The idea for this started out in the Spring Semester of 2018 while I was taking an Elementary Differential Geometry course. When poking around some other libraries in python, none really provided the functionality that was desired. I knew I needed to be able to construct N-dimensional curves. So this is where I began.

# What is used
Heavily dependent on the NumPy and SymPy packages. SymPy only supports 2 dimensional Curves so I built up my own implementation of Curves that is not restricted on solely 2 dimensions.

# Current Objectives
* Get intial code tested and pushed 
* Write up some docs on usage and mathematical foundations

# Going Forward
* Grow Geometry Code Base
* Extend GeomPy to other sectors of Mathematics (change name)
  * Dynamical Systems?
